# Breast Cancer Detection Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer (Malignant or Benign) based on various features. The dataset provides relevant medical measurements and classification labels. This notebook implements data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization for understanding breast cancer diagnosis.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To predict breast cancer diagnosis using classification models.
- **Dataset**: Publicly available dataset with features relevant to breast cancer diagnosis.
- **Modeling**: Various machine learning and deep learning models have been tested and compared for effectiveness.

## Files

- `breast_cancer_detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and model implementations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.
- `README.md`: Project description and setup instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure Python 3.6+ is installed. You may also want to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-detection.git
   cd breast-cancer-detection

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

    On Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install required packages**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook breast_cancer_detection.ipynb

 ### Project Structure

- **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis to understand feature distributions, relationships, and dataset balance.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, scaling, and splitting into training and testing sets.
- **Modeling**: Implementing and comparing various ML models, such as:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)


- **Evaluation**: Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.


### Results
The notebook includes visualizations and metric-based comparisons of each model. Evaluation metrics used include:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision and Recall**: Indicates model performance for each class.
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
